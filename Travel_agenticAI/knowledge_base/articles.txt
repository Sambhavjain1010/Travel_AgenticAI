From the snow-dusted, ski-worthy Pyrenees to the
glinting golden beaches
of the south,
Spain
unfolds in a series of ever-changing landscapes, traditions, attractions, cuisines and even languages.
Its vast natural spaces are a dream for those who love the great outdoors, while the
cities, towns and villages
fizz with energy, cultural jewels and mouth-watering gastronomy. But where to start? Whether youâre keen to get stuck into dazzling architecture, cycle to a secret beach or spend your days tasting wines, tapas or olive oils, here are 20 unmissable things to do in Spain.
1. Hike or ride to a secluded beach
Hitting the beach is a national hobby here, and youâll inevitably fall in love with your own pocket of Spainâs 5470km-long (3400-mile) coastline. Leave the crowds behind by escaping to tranquil, hidden coves that can only be reached on foot, on a bike or on horseback. Head out hiking along
Menorca
âs pine-shaded CamÃ­ de Cavalls (a restored 14th-century path) to reach turquoise coves; ramble between wild, pebble-studded bays along the Costa Brava; walk to remote sugar-white strands on
AndalucÃ­a
âs breezy Costa de la Luz (also great for kitesurfing); and find protected nudist beaches in AlmerÃ­aâs
Parque Natural Cabo de Gata
.
2. Feast on local specialties across Spain
A deep love of fabulous food infuses Spainâs soul. Youâll be crowding into
Granada
's tapas bars, grazing on
pintxos
(Basque tapas) in
Bilbao
and
San SebastiÃ¡n
,  seeking out creative Michelin stars in
Catalonia
, digging into super-fresh Valencian paellas by the Mediterranean, getting to know the countryâs 2023 Capital of Gastronomy
Cuenca
and much more.

3. Dive into art and nightlife in Madrid
Spainâs capital
is one of Europeâs greatest cities for art lovers, with a clutch of prestigious galleries where youâll meet such icons as Picassoâs
Guernica
(
Centro de Arte Reina SofÃ­a
), Van Goghâs
Les Vessenots in Auvers
(
Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza
), and VelÃ¡zquezâs
Las meninas
and Goyaâs
Saturno devorando a su hijo
(
Museo del Prado
). More hidden thrills range from sketches by poet Federico GarcÃ­a Lorca to mysterious works by Antoni TÃ pies. Pre-book tickets online and explore galleries first thing; some even offer "out of hours" tours before the doors officially open.
Planning tip:
Save some energy, though â later on,
one of the best things to do
in the capital city is join the
madrileÃ±os
at buzzy tapas spots, elegant cocktail lounges, laid-back rooftop bars, heaving clubs and more. The party inevitably goes on into the next morning.
4. Taste Spain's best wines
From headlining grape-growing regions such as
La Rioja
and the
cava
-making PenedÃ¨s to AndalucÃ­aâs unmatched Sherry Triangle, Spainâs 70 Denominaciones de Origen (Denominations of Origin) roll out a tantalizing line-up of wines. Many wineries here are now experimenting with unusual combinations, pushing forward sustainable production methods and working to recover rare ancestral grapes.
For the most exciting tours, seek out small, independent bodegas (some still run by their founding families) and track down lesser-known wine-making areas such as
Galicia
âs up-and-coming Ribeira Sacra, Cataloniaâs cool Costers del Segre or the innovative El Hierro and Lanzarote DOs in the
Canary Islands
. Salud!

5. Admire Modernisme in Barcelona with an insider
Exploring Cataloniaâs irresistible capital with
a local architect
instantly brings life to the Modernista wonders created by GaudÃ­, DomÃ¨nech i Montaner, Puig i Cadafalch and others in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Look beyond the star acts (
La Sagrada FamÃ­lia
,
Casa BatllÃ³
,
Park GÃ¼ell
), and donât miss GaudÃ­âs floral-tiled first commission
Casa Vicens
(in GrÃ cia) and other lesser-known Modernista flourishes around LâEixample and El Raval.
Planning tip:
Help combat Barcelonaâs much-discussed overtourism issues by
visiting outside high season
and weekends, staying in
officially licensed accommodations
and
exploring the rest of Catalonia
(from the heights of the Pyrenees to the rice-making Delta de lâEbre).
6. Road trip around Galiciaâs lyrical landscapes
Savoring a glass of crisp albariÃ±o with a platter of fresh-as-it-gets seafood is a distinctly Galician moment â just one of many surprises in Spainâs beautifully green northwest corner. Roam well beyond Santiago de Compostela to uncover timeworn stone villages, centuries-old wineries, plunging valleys and over 1000km (620 miles) of wild, windswept coastline sprinkled with sublime beaches, particularly around the Illas CÃ­es and the
Costa da Morte
.
Planning tip:
While summer brings the warmest weather, June and September are much quieter (always pack an umbrella!).

7. Wander off the beaten track in Extremadura
Portugal-bordering
Extremadura
plunges visitors into one of Spainâs least-touristed corners and is well worth a visit. The secluded Jerte, Ambroz and La Vera valleys reveal half-timbered houses, snow-topped mountains and spring cherry blossom, and thereâs outstanding birdwatching in the 180-sq-km (69-sq-mile) Parque Nacional de MonfragÃ¼e from March to October. There are also some extraordinary monumental cities, including
CÃ¡ceres
(with its glittering historical core), Trujillo (made wealthy by its high-profile conquistador families) and
MÃ©rida
(for some of Spainâs most important Roman ruins).
8. Walk an alternative Camino
Finally stumbling into the glittering cathedral in Galiciaâs capital
Santiago de Compostela
, after trekking hundreds of miles along the fabled Camino de Santiago (Way of St James), is a magical moment. Travelers seeking a less-trodden path can swap the popular traditional Camino FrancÃ©s for the wonderfully rewarding
Camino del Norte (Northern Way) or Camino Primitivo
. The 600km (373-mile) Norte meanders along and inland from Spainâs northern coastline from IrÃºn, while the challenging 320km (199-mile) Primitivo from Oviedo is believed to be the original Camino, walked by King Alfonso II back in the ninth century.
Planning tip:
You can combine the two routes by following an alternative branch of the Norte to Oviedo, then linking up with the Primitivo.

9. Bask in the beauty of AndalucÃ­aâs Moorish architecture
Spainâs eight centuries of Islamic rule produced some of its most spectacular architecture, particularly across AndalucÃ­a. The unmissable jewels of Moorish Al-Andalus are
Granada
âs
Alhambra
, CÃ³rdobaâs
Mezquita-Catedral
and Sevilleâs
Real AlcÃ¡zar
and
Giralda
, but thereâs plenty more. Travel between
CÃ³rdoba
and Granada along the little-known Ruta del Califato (Route of the Caliphate), whose castle-topped villages mark the final medieval frontier between Christian and Islamic Spain; ramble around the majestic
alcazabas
(fortified palaces) in
AlmerÃ­a
and
MÃ¡laga
; or head into
Huelva
âs remote Aracena hills to uncover a rare, perfectly preserved Moorish-era mosque.
10. Enjoy heavenly hikes in every season
Spainâs varied climate means there are outstanding hiking opportunities year-round â from Granadaâs snow-dusted Sierra Nevada (perfect in July/August) and northern Spainâs jagged
Parque Nacional de los Picos de Europa
to the cloud-brushing heights of
AragÃ³n
âs Parque Nacional de Ordesa y Monte Perdido and Cataloniaâs Parc Nacional dâAigÃ¼estortes i Estany de Sant Maurici. Along the coast, hit soul-stirringly beautiful trails such as the 200km-long (124-mile) CamiÃ±o dos Faros in Galicia or the clifftop paths in AlmerÃ­aâs Cabo de Gata.
Planning tip:
The north shines brightest from
June to September/October
(book accommodations ahead), while walking in AndalucÃ­a is best from March to June and in September and October.

11. Stroll between AndalucÃ­aâs white villages
Sunny AndalucÃ­a is dotted with impossibly scenic
pueblos blancos
(white villages), with two main pockets in rural CÃ¡diz and Granadaâs Alpujarras valleys â and while these make for
fascinating road trips
, a series of serene rural walking paths also track between them. Venture off on the long-distance GR7 in the remote eastern Alpujarras (Mairena and TrevÃ©lez villages are highlights), or lace up your walking boots in CÃ¡dizâs Sierra de Grazalema, where Moorish castles, rare
pinsapos
(Spanish firs) and rust-roof villages await.
12. Learn about Spainâs finest olive oil
If youâve ever wondered where those liquid-gold Spanish olive oils come from, central AndalucÃ­aâs Mar de Olivos (Sea of Olives) is a hidden-in-plain-sight joy. Some of the worldâs top-tier olive oils are produced among its 15,000 sq km (5790 sq miles) of rolling hills, craggy peaks and silent valleys, particularly across JaÃ©n and CÃ³rdoba provinces (where Priego de CÃ³rdoba in the Sierra SubbÃ©tica is the shining star). Stay in one of the regionâs peaceful rural hotels, some of which offer home-cooked meals using their own olive oils, and visit local
almazaras
(olive mills) for tastings, tours and strolls among the olive groves.

13. Take your pick of the Canary Islands
Around 1000km (620 miles) southwest of mainland Spain, the eight sunbathed
Canaries
pack in everything from Atlantic volcanic beaches and eerily beautiful pine forests to hikes up the countryâs tallest peak, 3715m-high (12,100ft)
Teide
.
Planning tip:
Picking just one island can be a challenge â
hereâs our in-depth Canary Islands guide
to help you narrow it down.
14. Spot rare wildlife in a remote natural wonderland
In recent years, major conservation efforts have brought several of Spainâs most beloved threatened species back from the brink of extinction, including the Iberian lynx, the Cantabrian brown bear and the majestic
quebrantahuesos
(bearded vulture). Head out in AndalucÃ­aâs mountainous Parque Natural Sierra de AndÃºjar for the chance to see a lynx, or venture to the remote Parque Natural de Somiedo in southwest
Asturias
to (perhaps!) spy a brown bear.

15. Go surfing and exploring along Spainâs green north coast
Some of Spainâs top surf beaches are hidden along the cliff-edged northern coastline, hugging the Basque Country, Cantabria, Asturias and Galicia. While here, explore stone-built villages, extraordinary galleries, ancient cave art, lively cities, local cider and spectacular mountain ranges.
16. Engage in responsible tourism in the Balearics
Forget the dance-until-dawn stereotypes â the four Balearics islands make up one of the Mediterraneanâs most blissful escapes, with a strong drive towards
responsible tourism
that includes a ban on single-use plastics since early 2021. Whether you fancy seductive
Mallorca
, soothing
Menorca
, always-chic
Ibiza
or barefoot-beach
Formentera
, you can stay in a stylish environment-first
agroturisme
, learn about the islandsâ artisan traditions (from cheese-making to basketry), get involved in beach clean-ups, and soak up the outdoors on hikes, kayak trips, horseback-riding adventures and more.

17. Experience flamenco in its AndalucÃ­an heartland
There are flamenco shows all over Spain, but the most inspiring place to lose yourself in this soulful ancient art is its southern birthplace: the CÃ¡diz-Jerez-Seville triangle. Hunt down events at local
peÃ±as
(flamenco clubs), and donât miss
Jerez
âs lively
tabancos
, where fiery shows are served up alongside sherry poured straight from the barrel.
Planning tip:
If you've ever dreamed of learning to dance, this is the ideal place to pick up a few flamenco steps of your own.
18. Wake up in magical accommodations
Fancy slumbering away in a medieval monastery, a fairy-tale castle or a Renaissance palace? Book in at one of Spainâs 98 wonderfully atmospheric
paradores
, which revolve around sensitively converted buildings packed with centuries of history. Or hunt down a seductive independent stay with its own backstory: a chicly reimagined Modernista mansion in Barcelona, a Balearic farmhouse hidden down a dusty pine-scented track, an artily reimagined home in CÃ¡dizâs Vejer de la Frontera. Many of Spainâs most exciting accommodation spots are attractions in their own right, fueled by inspired, creative design.

19. Get lost in lively, forward-looking Valencia
With its pioneering plans for achieving
carbon-neutral tourism
,
Valencia
(Spainâs third-largest city) is becoming a hot tourist favorite. In a short visit, you could be uncovering the
Mercado Central
âs market-fresh meals, intriguing museums and varied architecture, exploring Santiago de Calatravaâs
Ciudad de las Artes y las Ciencias
, savoring seafood in El Cabanyal, cycling along the seafront and more.
Planning tip:
The Fallas de Valencia festival makes March an outrageously popular month to visit Valencia, but this sunny Mediterranean city is also a
perfect autumn or winter escape
.
20. Marvel at an ancient (or not so ancient) cathedral
Most Spanish cities unravel around a central plaza overlooked by a formidable cathedral, with styles stretching from Romanesque to Modernista. The countryâs most architecturally and spiritually moving cathedrals include LeÃ³n,
Toledo
,
Salamanca
, Seville,
Burgos
, Granada,
Segovia
, Santiago de Compostela and
Palma de Mallorca
, as well as Barcelonaâs Sagrada FamÃ­lia.
Planning tip:
Climbing up a cathedral tower or joining one of an ever-growing number of rooftop tours is a fantastic way to find a fresh perspective on the city below.
